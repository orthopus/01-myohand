This repository contents the documentation of the ORTHOPUS' prosthetic myohand which is currently under development.

This new myoelectric prosthetic hand goes beyond the three-fingered  hands where the thumb faces the index and middle finger. Its specificity lies in the fact its thumb has flexion and abduction mobility. Thanks to the myoelectric sensors (called electromyography ) on his/her  residual arm, the user can control the prosthetic by simply contracting  his/her muscles.

The purpose of this prosthetic hand is to make  everyday life easier and extend the autonomy of upper-limb amputees by  helping them easily grip and handle objects with strength and precision.
